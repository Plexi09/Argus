# Argus Plugin

*Moderator Utilities for the Sunrise Network*

---

## Introduction

**Argus** is a powerful moderation utility plugin designed to assist moderators on the **Sunrise Network**. It provides a suite of commands to help maintain order and fairness in the game.

---

## The Mythological Background of Argus

In Greek mythology, **Argus Panoptes** was a giant with a hundred eyes. Known for his vigilance, Argus was an all-seeing guardian, often depicted as a watchful protector who never slept. At any given time, some of his eyes were always open, ensuring nothing escaped his notice.

### Why "Argus"?

The name **Argus** was chosen for this plugin to symbolize its purpose and functionality:
- **Vigilance**: Just like Argus, the plugin keeps a constant watch over the server, monitoring player activities and inventories.
- **All-seeing**: With its comprehensive suite of commands, Argus allows moderators to observe and manage the server effectively, ensuring a fair and safe environment for all players.

## Disclaimer

**Argus is not an anti-cheat plugin.** While it provides tools for moderators to monitor player activities and detect suspicious behavior, it does not automatically prevent or detect cheating. For effective server management, it is recommended to use Argus in conjunction with dedicated anti-cheat plugins.
